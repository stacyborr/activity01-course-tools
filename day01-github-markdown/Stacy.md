   This meme expresses my sense of impending doom over the imposter-syndrome I feel in the DSA program as someone from completely outside of computer sciences until recently and that I try to just pretend that I know what I'm doing and play along but feel internal panic at being in way over my head.
   
   I prefer written sharing of feedback and reactions.
